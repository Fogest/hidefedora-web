Hide Fedora Website
==================

This is the code for the hide-fedora website

To develop in this project here are the steps you must follow:

1. git clone git@github.com:Fogest/hidefedora-web.git
2. cp phplib/template-config.php phplib/config.php (Copy the template config file and then edit in settings. Config file is in .gitignore)
3. Import the hidefedora.sql schema into your database. The sql file also contains a sample user record which can be modified for your use to login.
4. You should be set to go at this point. 

If you have any problems let me know. The site is using a custom templating backend I made so if there are any issues I'm sorry, it is still under development :).

Pull requests are definitely welcome!
